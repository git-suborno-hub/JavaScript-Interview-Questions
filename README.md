## üü¢ Basics

### 1. What are the different data types in JavaScript?
<a id="what-are-the-different-data-types-in-javascript"></a>
JavaScript provides different data types including:
- Primitive types: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt
- Non-primitive types: Objects (including Arrays, Functions, etc.)

---

### 2. Difference between var, let, and const
<a id="difference-between-var-let-and-const"></a>
- `var` is function-scoped, can be re-declared and updated.
- `let` is block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.
- `const` is block-scoped, cannot be updated or re-declared after initialization.

---

### 3. How does type coercion work?
<a id="how-does-type-coercion-work"></a>
- Type coercion in JavaScript refers to the automatic or implicit conversion of one data type to another. This occurs when JavaScript expects a value of a certain type but encounters a different one, and the language tries to convert it to the expected type.

There are two types of type coercion:

- Implicit Coercion: Automatically done by JavaScript when an operation involves different types.

- Explicit Coercion: When you manually convert one type to another using functions like String(), Number(), Boolean(), etc.

### 4. What are truthy and falsy values?
<a id="what-are-truthy-and-falsy-values"></a>
-- Falsy Values:
These are the values that are considered false when coerced into a Boolean. There are only 6 falsy values in JavaScript:

-false (the Boolean false)

-0 (zero)

-"" (empty string)

-null

-undefined

-NaN (Not-a-Number)

--Truthy Values:
All values except the falsy ones are considered truthy. This means that any value that is not falsy will be treated as true in a Boolean context.

-For example:

Non-empty strings (e.g., "Hello")

Non-zero numbers (e.g., 1, -1, 3.14)

Objects (including arrays, functions, etc.)

true (the Boolean true)

Infinity (positive and negative infinity)

Dates (e.g., new Date())
